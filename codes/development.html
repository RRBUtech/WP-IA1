        <h2>Book Reflection: "Twelve Pillars" by Jim Rohn</h2>
        <p>I have read chapters 4 – 7 of "Twelve Pillars," and here is a summary of my key takeaways:</p>
        <p>
            Reading these chapters made me realize how essential intentionality is in life. Applying these lessons can significantly impact personal and professional growth.

            Goal Setting: I often set general goals but don’t always write them down or track them consistently. Moving forward, I plan to create a structured goal-setting system where I define my goals clearly and review them weekly.

            Time Management: I sometimes get caught up in small, less important tasks. By applying the 80/20 rule, I will identify the key activities that contribute most to my success and focus my energy on them.

            Choosing the Right People: This chapter resonated with me because I’ve noticed how surrounding myself with ambitious people pushes me to do better. I will make a conscious effort to seek mentorship and build relationships with people who inspire me.

            Continuous Learning: I realize that to stay competitive and grow, I need to commit to daily learning—whether through books, courses, or real-world experiences. I will set a goal to read at least one book per month and continuously develop my skills.

            These principles remind me that success is not accidental—it’s built through conscious effort, discipline, and the right influences. By integrating these habits into my life, I can create a solid foundation for long-term growth.
