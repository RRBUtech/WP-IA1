        <h2>My Strongest Trait</h2>
        <p>Curiosity and Eagerness to Learn: I have an insatiable desire to expand my knowledge and explore new ideas. Whether it's mastering new technologies, understanding complex concepts, or developing new skills, I embrace continuous learning as a way to grow and adapt in an ever-evolving world.</p>

        <h2>My Hero</h2>
        <p>Steve Jobs: A visionary who transformed the world through innovation, design, and relentless pursuit of excellence. His ability to merge technology with artistry inspires me to think boldly, challenge the status quo, and create impactful solutions.</p>

        <h2>Personality Test</h2>
        <img src="../assets/keirsay.png" alt="Personality Test Result" width="300">
        <p>The Keirsey Assessment categorizes me as a Guardian, which aligns with my personality in many ways. Guardians are typically responsible, detail-oriented, and value structure and security—traits that resonate with how I approach my studies, work, and personal life. In general, I believe personality tests like this can provide valuable insights into individual strengths, tendencies, and behaviors. However, while they offer a useful framework for understanding oneself, they are not absolute definitions of a person’s character. People are complex and adaptable, and external factors such as experiences and environment also shape personality. In my case, the Guardian description feels mostly accurate, but I recognize that I also exhibit traits from other personality types depending on the situation. Overall, I find the test to be a helpful tool for self-reflection and personal growth.</p>
